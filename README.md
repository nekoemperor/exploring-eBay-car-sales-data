At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app.

## Goals:
The aim of the project are: 
* find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. 
* analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users. 

As data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.
